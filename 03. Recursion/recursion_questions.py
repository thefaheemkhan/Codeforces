#### Recursion Cheat Sheet
-> Base Case: Every recursive function must have one or more base cases to terminate the recursion. Base cases represent the simplest form of the problem and can be solved directly.
-> Recursive Step: Recursive functions break down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem. Each recursive call should bring the problem closer to the base case.
-> Convergence: Recursive algorithms must converge towards the base case(s) to terminate. Improper convergence can lead to infinite recursion.
-> Stack: Recursion uses the call stack to store information about each recursive call. Excessive recursion can lead to stack overflow errors.

#### Example Problems:
-> Factorial: Computing the factorial of a number.
-> Fibonacci Sequence: Generating Fibonacci numbers.
-> Tree Traversal: Pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal of binary trees.
-> Recursive Binary Search: Searching for an element in a sorted array using recursion.
-> Merge Sort and Quick Sort: Sorting algorithms that use recursion.

#### Pros:
-> Elegant and intuitive solution for problems that can be divided into smaller subproblems.
-> Simplifies the code and makes it easier to understand.

#### Cons:
-> May consume more memory due to the overhead of function calls and maintaining the call stack.
-> Excessive recursion can lead to stack overflow errors.
-> Not always the most efficient solution, especially for problems with overlapping subproblems.

#### Optimization:
-> Tail Recursion: Optimizing recursive functions where the recursive call is the last operation performed.
-> Memoization: Storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them to avoid redundant computations (dynamic programming).
-> Practice: Regular practice and understanding of recursion are essential to master its concepts and applications.
